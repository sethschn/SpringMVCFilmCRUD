## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

### Week 8 Team Homework


### Overview
This project implemented teamwork through GitHub collaboration and focused on building a full-stack application with the ability to modify database entries. Using Gradle, our application has the ability to query a database and display the results on a webpage, which we run out of Eclipse/Spring Tool Suite.


### Technologies Used and Lessons Learned
#### Technologies
* Spring Tool Suite
* GitHub
* Git
* Gradle
* Java
* HTML
* Apache/Tomcat
* Java Servlet Pages

#### Lessons Learned
Throughout the project, our collaboration forced us to be in constant communication as we wrote portions of our application. We learned it was easy to overwrite another peer's contribution to the project if we were not careful with out GitHub pushes. After realizing how easy it was to destroy another peer's work, we decided to compartmentalize the tasks to prevent further issues. Another important issue we had to overcome was preventing a refreshed page from inserting data into the database. Solving redundant entries meant implementing a post-get redirect to control.
